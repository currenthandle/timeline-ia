			<p>Air Force Secretary Deborah Lee James recently <a href='http://www.airforcetimes.com/story/military/2015/12/17/air-force-have-enlisted-pilots-first-time-since-world-war-'>announced</a> that for the first time since World War II enlisted personnel will be allowed to pilot aircraft. Or, more specifically, drones. It’s a huge change, so radical that it has the potential to completely alter the class structure of the military.</p>
			
			<p>In order to understand it, you have to know something about the way the military is divided: into enlisted personnel and commissioned officers. The simple analogy is to think of enlisted guys as blue-collar workers and officers as white-collar. Enlisted guys work with their hands more, don’t get desks in offices until they’ve been in for a while, and constitute the bulk of people out “in the shit.” Call a senior enlisted person “Sir” and you might get the clichéd response: “Sir? I’m not an officer. I work for a living.”</p>
			
			<p>Enlisted personnel focus on specific jobs. Officers, who are required to have college degrees, focus on command and deployment of the enlisted. When people talk about their “chain of command,” they are talking about the officers they serve under.</p>

			<p>You wouldn’t be wrong to sense a pretty strong class divide here. And despite the American military being substantially more egalitarian than other militaries, that’s exactly what it is. Its antecedents stretch back at least to the Middle Ages. Then, there were mounted knights of lesser nobility and local peasants pressed into service as foot soldiers. That divide was eventually complicated and dissolved by technology also — by the longbow and the gun. And that’s the dynamic we should look to if we want to understand how expensively trained and outfitted members of the quasi-noble caste can be eventually supplanted by working-class teenagers with itchy trigger fingers.</p>
			
			<p>To train, equip, and maintain a mounted knight during the height of the Middle Ages was not cheap. The armor of an English knight in 1374 cost, <a href='http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/aams/hd_aams.htm'>according</a> to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the “equivalent of about five to eight years of rent for a London merchant’s house, or over three years worth of wages for a skilled laborer, a single helmet (a bascinet, probably with aventail) being worth the purchase price of a cow.”</p>
			
			<p>That’s just the armor. The knight also had the expense of maintaining a battle horse, an extensive staff, an estate, etc. The handsomely outfitted warriors, for a time unstoppable on the battlefield, used their power to consolidate their economic status. “Improved armor raised the cost of military equipment while widening the gulf between the effectiveness of a peasant spearman and a fully equipped warrior. …The knight was enormously expensive to train, maintain, and equip, but he was virtually unbeatable on the battlefield,” Jeffrey Singman <a href='https://books.google.com/books/about/Daily_Life_in_Medieval_Europe.html?id=SOdNT0xFnJsC'>writes</a> in Daily Life in Medieval Europe.</p>
			
			<p>A military revolution in the late Middle Ages destroyed not only the knight’s place on the battlefield, but his role in society as well. Andrew Ayton and J.L. Price identify three major shifts that killed the knight and ushered in a new stage of warfare: (1) inexpensive and effective handheld weapons for the infantry, such as longbows, pikes, and eventually guns, (2) the development of long range artillery, and (3) social changes that made it more cost-effective to raise large armies of mercenaries and peasants than relying on a small and expensive noble caste to do the fighting. The knights were rendered obsolete by relatively cheap weaponry that anyone could pick up and use with minimal training. This is exactly what’s happening now with conventional pilots and drone technology.</p>

			<p>Think of planes and their pilots as mounted knights in the sky. In fact, since their very beginnings during World War I, that’s exactly how people have <a href='http://www.history.com/news/history-lists/6-famous-wwi-fighter-aces'>thought</a> of them, especially fighter aces. They were for a time virtually untouchable, literally set above the fray and doing battle only with one another. But the price to train pilots and, more importantly, outfit them with cutting-edge technology, has become an obscene burden.</p>
			
			<p>The F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, America’s most recently developed fighter plane, is the most expensive weapon in human history. The planes will cost $400 billion in total, but the Government Accountability Office expects that they’ll cost nearly $1 trillion to maintain over the course of their lifetimes. The plane doesn’t even work all that well, and the project has been bogged down with a slew of <a href='http://www.businessinsider.com/here-are-all-the-problems-with-the-f-35-that-the-pentagon-found-in-a-2014-report-2015-3'>problems</a>. The fighter that came before the F-35, the F-22 Raptor, is by all accounts a wonderful plane. But they cost $139 million each and the Pentagon halted their production because of it.</p>
			
			<p>By contrast, drones are cheap. The MQ-Predator only costs $4 million, and drones are expected to get <a href='http://www.popsci.com/air-force-wants-cheap-attack-drones-it-can-lose-war'>cheaper</a> in the future. What’s more, if they crash, the pilot doesn’t die. F-22 pilot training <a href='http://articles.latimes.com/2013/jul/22/business/la-fi-fighter-pilot-wanted-20130722'>costs</a> $6 million, none of which can be outsourced, and all of which is lost if the pilot goes down with the plane. The military is already looking into cheap, <a href='http://about.bgov.com/blog/a-booming-new-business-drone-pilot-training/'>private options</a> for training drone pilots.</p>
			
			<p>So basically a cost curve in equipment and training is making the knights of the sky obsolete, mirroring what happened to mounted knights of the Middle Ages. And just as those knights slowly dissipated as a distinct social class, we see new technology dissolving the class divide between officers and the enlisted. It might seem like a leveling of hierarchy in the military is a move towards egalitarianism, but don’t be so sure. More likely, it’s simply the result of a cost-benefit analysis. And soon, if the trend continues in the direction it’s going, we might not have human operators of drone systems at all.</p>
