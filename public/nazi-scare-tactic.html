			<p>Billing itself as a “brave young Polish weekly,” W Sieci wasn’t particularly brave in its choice of cover: a blonde woman wearing the European Union flag as a toga, being groped by meaty, hairy arms. W Sieci’s cover story was titled “Islam’s rape of Europe.”</p>

				<p>The title references Roman myth — Jupiter’s rape of princess Europa. But the creepy image of swarthy hands defiling a fair white maiden is a 20th-century scare tactic. The United States brought the myth into World War I, depicting a Germanic ape carrying a ravished chestnut-haired woman.</p>

				<p>During World War II Japanese propagandists preyed on American racial fears (no, African Americans were <a href='https://www.gilderlehrman.org/history-by-era/world-war-ii/essays/patriotism-crosses-color-line-african-americans-world-war-ii'>not the bosses</a> of any US town during World War II):</p>

				<p>But it was fascists that made the threat much more explicit. The Italians printed these posters showing American soldiers carrying off Italian women:</p>

				<p>Occupied Poland was put under Bolshevik watch (the starvlings are a nice touch):</p>

				<p>And Nazi propagandists dropped leaflets on US soldiers depicting a rape scene near a dead body:</p>

				<p>This sort of imagery peeks its ugly head out when people are at war. Or at least feel that they’re at war — the visual language of W Sieci tells its audience that there’s a sexualized threat to the nation’s women and the nation’s honor.</p>

				<p>But it’s an old tactic used to attack an amorphous, animalistic “other.” The gruesome depictions were once a dirty way to fight a war. Now they’re just a desperate ploy to sell magazines.</p>
