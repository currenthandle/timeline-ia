			<p>rom scribbled tags to intricate murals, Los Angeles is blanketed in graffiti. But one new graffiti find is being hailed as a rare discovery.</p>
			
			<p>Susan Phillips, an anthropologist who studies graffiti, was exploring under a century-old bridge in Los Angeles when she made a stunning <a href='http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/53241721c169476ab44f4d1c34180cc6/anthropologist-follows-trail-century-old-hobo-graffiti'>archaeological find</a>: a cluster of markings left behind by freight train-hopping hobos in the early 20th century. Such discoveries are uncommon: hobos tended to use grease pencil and chalk, or sometimes etched with railroad ties, so their markings have mostly faded.</p>
			
			<p>The markings Phillips found were left behind by hobos named Oakland Red, the Tucson Kid, and A-No.1. The latter was the pseudonym of Leon Ray Livingston, known during his lifetime as the King of the Hoboes. An autodidact, Livingston wrote a dozen books on the hobo way of life. “I began out of necessity,” he reflected after a life of traveling, “and continued because I loved the life, and now because I know nothing else.” His gravestone in Pennsylvania reads “A-No.1 at rest at last.”</p>

			<p>He got his moniker in the late 19th century from a veteran hobo named Frenchy. “Every tramp gives his kid a nickname that will distinguish him from all other members of the craft,” Livingston <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=AfPtCWL3J4oC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=a+no.1&source=bl&ots=rWV0ABr9PX&sig=hCZ1XtLRB5PAlf58z4GvDKYkuEE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihqeqC_YTNAhVO3mMKHeqzALgQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&q&f=false'>remembers</a> Frenchy explaining in his memoir <i>Life and Adventures of A-No.1 — America’s Most Celebrated Tramp</i>. As the culture evolved, the most popular <a href='http://thehobotimes.com/hobo%20history.html'>formula</a> for generating a moniker was to place a noun in front of a single name, e.g. Rambling Rudy, Gas Can Paddy, Reefer Charlie, and Sailor Jack (the latter was the hobo pseudonym of author Jack London when he rode the rails).</p>

			<p>Livingston’s books romanticized and popularized the hobo lifestyle while also giving practical tips on how to sustain it. Among other contributions to the culture — which had started with the building of the railroads and flourished at the turn of the century — he documented and standardized the system of symbols that hoboes used to communicate with each other.</p>
			
			<p>In hobo symbology, two interlocked circles signified handcuffs, i.e. a police presence, while a cross signified a church offering free food, and a cat meant the presence of a kind or helpful woman. There were signs indicating whether the local jail was clean or filthy, whether a house had a hostile owner or a vicious dog, and whether the local doctor would offer treatment for no charge.</p>

			<p>While the hoboing phenomenon reached its peak during the Great Depression — evidence that many turned to riding the rails because their economic prospects were otherwise limited — Livingston was adamant that train-hopping was a choice. Poor people would do better to stay in one place and work, if economic stability was their aim.</p>

			<p>But what the hobo life lacked in security, it made up for in freedom and adventure. The pull of the open road proved irresistible to a select few. “Many times in my wanderings,” Livingston <a href='https://books.google.com/books?id=AfPtCWL3J4oC&pg=PA44&lpg=PA44&dq=a+no.1&source=bl&ots=rWV0ABr9PX&sig=hCZ1XtLRB5PAlf58z4GvDKYkuEE&hl=en&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwihqeqC_YTNAhVO3mMKHeqzALgQ6AEINTAE#v=onepage&q&f=false'>wrote</a>, “strangers as well as acquaintances, interested in the tramp problem, have asked me, ‘What is the reason, A-No.1, that you should tramp?’ I will confess here that… I cannot stop, in spite of all my numerous attempts to conquer the ‘Wanderlust’! Ask any other victim of this strange malady — tramp, commercial traveler, railroad man, circus follower, etc. — and all will attest to the very same inability to shake off the desire to wander.”</p>
			
			<p>“It’s just like a fluke down there in LA that that survived,” <a href='http://www.bigstory.ap.org/article/53241721c169476ab44f4d1c34180cc6/anthropologist-follows-trail-century-old-hobo-graffiti'>said</a> Bill Daniel, the editor of a book of hobo graffiti, of Phillips’ discovery. In a city that boasts scant remaining infrastructure from the early 20th century that isn’t covered over by decades of more recent graffiti, Phillips’ find is an impressive window into a distant time and culture.</p>
			
			<p>“Those little heart things are actually stylized arrows that are pointing up the river,” Phillips said, describing a mark left by A-No.1 in 1914. “Putting those arrows that way means ‘I’m going upriver. I was here on this date and I’m going upriver.’” Under A-No.1’s mark was a sketch of a cowboy riding a bronco, drawn by the Tucson Kid in 1921. And nearby, the signature of Oakland Red, drawn in bulky block caps and shaded in a way that resembles modern-day graffiti.</p>
			
			<p>“A lot of the stuff I’ve documented through time has been destroyed, either by the city or by other graffiti writers,” Phillips said, “and that is just the way of graffiti.” Like their authors, hobo markings rarely stay in one place for so long.</p>
