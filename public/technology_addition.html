			<p>When a new thing comes along people say it’ll never catch on. When it catches on they say it’s a fad. When the fad gains enough traction, they say it’s an addiction. Let’s see where we’ve gotten our fix over the years…</p>
			
			<h2>Novels</h2>
			
			<p>When books came down in cost, novels became a popular form of entertainment, with some calling the new trend “reading mania” or “reading lust.” In 1795, author J. G. Heinzmann insisted that such devotion caused “weakening of the eyes, heat rashes, gout, arthritis, hemorrhoids, asthma, apoplexy, pulmonary disease, indigestion, blocking of the bowels, nervous disorder, migraines, epilepsy, hypochondria and melancholy.” Turns out, not so much.</p>
			
			<p>In 1888 an <a href='http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=950CE4D81230E633A25754C2A96E9C94699FD7CF'>article</a> called novel reading “evil” and compared it to “dram drinking” (an old-time term for boozing.)</p>

			<p>In 1897 it was reported that a <a href='http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9A03E3D91230E333A2575BC0A9609C94669ED7CF'>sermon</a> given by a minster decried novel reading, the minister proclaimed: “Perhaps ninety-nine out of a hundred are baleful, an outrage on decency and common sense.” A novel was also blamed for corruption of morals and even a <a href='http://www.historytoday.com/frank-furedi/media%E2%80%99s-first-moral-panic'>wave of suicidesa</a>.</p>
			
			<p>In the late 1800s and early 1900s cheap novels for children, called dime novels, became popular. An addiction to them was seen as <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19580928&id=11dWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KkMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5529,5288482&hl=en'>the cause</a> of two boys shooting a stranger in 1883. They were also blamed for a number of other crimes committed by kids (<a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=37&dat=19040318&id=1GwEAAAAIBAJ&sjid=PikDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3805,4107748&hl=en'>1</a>, <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1888&dat=18760707&id=8etJAAAAIBAJ&sjid=3yoDAAAAIBAJ&pg=2608,4780975&hl=en'>2</a>).</p>

			<h2>Telephones</h2>
			
			<p>In 1958, phones were called a teenage addiction by <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1955&dat=19580928&id=11dWAAAAIBAJ&sjid=KkMNAAAAIBAJ&pg=5529,5288482&hl=en'>one article</a>, with one “expert psychoanalyst” blaming “examples set by similarly addicted mothers.”</p>

      </figure>
			
			<p>The psychoanalyst also claimed “telephone addicts are driven by a desire somewhat akin to the child’s earlier infantile need for actual bodily contact with the mother.”</p>
			
			<p>As late as 1984, an <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19841024&id=Zv4tAAAAIBAJ&sjid=C2kEAAAAIBAJ&pg=2925,2802440&hl=en'>article</a> claimed “One of the most serious, unreported, disabling, anti-social diseases in America today is that of telephone addiction.”</p>
			
			<p>When telephones became available on flights, it was seen as just another way for telephone addicts to get their “fix.”</p>

			<h2>Comic books</h2>
			
			<p>When comics rose in popularity, “comic book addiction” was used as a defense in a number of court cases. Pictured <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1873&dat=19480405&id=ifUnAAAAIBAJ&sjid=wMcEAAAAIBAJ&pg=4936,2356086&hl=en'>below</a>, a defense attorney, and a child accused of committing a murder, posing for press photographs.</p>

			<p>Addiction to comics was also blamed for <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1144&dat=19480823&id=9VwbAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Ik0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=2610,2671249&hl=en'>a horrific assault</a> by three young boys in Indiana.</p>

      </figure>
			
			<p>Comics were the perfect scapegoat for unthinkable crimes committed by children, and defense lawyers exploited the fear. Psychiatrist <a href='http://www.wymann.info/comics/025-Wertham1940s.html'>Fredric Werham</a> wrote a book on the subject titled Seduction of the Innocent that explored the dangers of this strange new vice. It was a bestseller.</p>
			
			<h2>Radio</h2>
			
			<p>In 1936, prominent education author <a href='http://www.futureofchildren.org/publications/journals/article/index.xml?journalid=45&articleid=201&sectionid=1310'>Azriel L. Eisenberg</a> argued that radio had “brought many a disturbing influence in its wake,” and that parents “cannot lock out this intruder because it has gained an invincible hold of their children.”</p>
			
			<p>Radio listening habits were also <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&dat=19391207&id=QexPAAAAIBAJ&sjid=plQDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5675,4495165&hl=en'>lamented</a> in 1939 as replacing more traditional childhood pastimes, like playing cops and robbers.</p>

			<p>A 1946 Parent Teacher Association <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19461103&id=tC1QAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Wg0EAAAAIBAJ&pg=7175,4513602&hl=en'>report</a> stated that radio could be used as a “means of emotional overstimulation or as a retreat into a shadow world of reality.” Excessive listening was, no surprise, also partly <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1300&dat=19570702&id=Y2EQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=sZUDAAAAIBAJ&pg=6937,147258&hl=en'>blamed</a> for a murder committed by a 14-year-old in 1957.</p>
			
			<h2>Television</h2>
			
			<p>Television was the archetype of addictive technologies for decades. A 1977 New York Times review of the <a href='http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9E04E7D6113BE63BBC4851DFB566838C669EDE'>The Plugin Drug</a> asked “Does television hurt the head?”</p>

			<p>A psychoanalyst in <a href='http://query.nytimes.com/mem/archive-free/pdf?res=9D03E3DB153CE03BBC4151DFB466838D649EDE'>1956</a> said, “Television watching can be habit-forming to the point of real addiction, requiring professional help to cure.” Some said not only that TV was addictive, but that there was <a href='http://1980%20https//news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&dat=19801109&id=rrpfAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YecFAAAAIBAJ&pg=5934,1620640&hl=en'>no cure</a>. Others <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=20010614&id=lVcxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=UAgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6616,5658445&hl=en'>compared</a> it to opiates.</p>

			<p>The drug addiction comparisons <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=886&dat=19910324&id=RkhNAAAAIBAJ&sjid=YYIDAAAAIBAJ&pg=5934,4236372&hl=en'>kept coming</a>. As with other entertainment mediums before it, television’s effect on children was a <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1368&dat=19671003&id=CsQVAAAAIBAJ&sjid=LxEEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6659,288406&hl=en'>big concern</a> and like with dime novels and comics, addiction to it was <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1916&dat=19771008&id=dOkgAAAAIBAJ&sjid=Mm4FAAAAIBAJ&pg=1040,1592554&hl=en'>blamed for murders.</a></p>

			<h2>Video games</h2>
			
			<p>In 1981 video games were called the “<a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1755&dat=19810721&id=bvIcAAAAIBAJ&sjid=CGgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=6799,2579189&hl=en'>newest addiction</a>,” retreading the same panicked ground.</p>

        <img src='https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*oMS-AA-78ST0aIHDnLeNBQ.png'>
      </figure>
			
			<p>In 1982, the “magnetic pull of coin-operated video games” prompted parents to call on local governments to <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1982/06/03/garden/issue-and-debate-should-video-games-be-restricted-by-law.html'>ban them</a> in commercial outlets. At the end of the 80s a New York Times writer, unsurprisingly, <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/11/nyregion/long-island-opinion-video-game-mania-passing-phase-or-permanent-addiction.html'>compared</a> Nintendo to opiates.</p>

			<p>China banned video game consoles in 2000, citing “<a href='http://kotaku.com/5587577/why-are-consoles-banned-in-china'>parental outcry</a>” and concerns around video game addiction. The ban stayed in place for 14 years.</p>

			<p>The same year, the president of the National Counseling Intervention Services <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1129&dat=20000106&id=QjAxAAAAIBAJ&sjid=JHADAAAAIBAJ&pg=4720,3920347&hl=en'>said</a>, “people don’t recognize yet that a person who is unable to control their use of the computer has the same by-products as a drug user.” Another headline compared them to a “<a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2181&dat=20071114&id=9_IkAAAAIBAJ&sjid=bhEGAAAAIBAJ&pg=2159,3190486&hl=en'>junkie’s rush.</a>”</p>
			
			<h2>Internet</h2>
			
			<p>Internet addiction is something people still refer to today, but the idea basically started with the widespread availability of the web at home.</p>

			<p>“Symptoms of Internet Addiction” ran in a 1996 issue of the New York Times and in the <a href='http://www.nytimes.com/1996/12/01/weekinreview/the-symptoms-of-internet-addiction.html'>opening</a> paragraphs asked, “Had he been hooked on heroin? Cocaine? Jim Beam? Joe Camel? No, his psychologist said. The teen-ager had withdrawn cold turkey from the Internet.”</p>

			<p>A case of child neglect stemming from a clear mental health condition was blamed on <a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1241&dat=19970719&id=M3FTAAAAIBAJ&sjid=HIYDAAAAIBAJ&pg=3998,2545638&hl=en'>internet addiction</a> in 1997, and in 1998 a Reuters survey purportedly showed “<a href='https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1356&dat=19980303&id=DAJQAAAAIBAJ&sjid=TAgEAAAAIBAJ&pg=5014,2807997&hl=en'>dataholics</a>” were proliferating.</p>
			
			<p>The internet-addiction narrative has only grown louder with the rise of mobile access. It continues to be a source of Catholic-like guilt for many people, a modern sin. Twenty years after the first example, this story was published just days ago:</p>
			
			
			<p><a href='http://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/gadgets-and-tech/this-dark-side-of-the-internet-is-costing-young-people-their-jobs-and-social-lives-a7041451.html'>Internet addiction is costing young people their jobs and social lives</a></p>
			
			<h2>Smartphones</h2>
			
			
			<p>First came the Blackberry, which was quickly nicknamed “Crackberry,” then came the iPhone and Android phones. With so many use cases, it’s no surprise smartphones are called addictive. They’re a “<a href='http://au.pcmag.com/smartphones/40330/opinion/smartphone-addiction-is-a-plague'>plague</a>” according to no less than M.I.T. professor Sherry Turkle. There are <a href='http://www.netaddictionrecovery.com/smart-phone-addiction.html'>retreats</a> for smartphone addicts and the condition even has a clinical name, ‘nomophobia.’</p>
			
			<p><a href='http://dailytimes.com.pk/infotainment/29-Apr-16/is-nomophobia-real-if-your-phone-died-right-now-would-you-have-a-panic-attack'>Is nomophobia real? : If your phone died right now, would you have a panic attack?</a></p>
			
			<p>There have been numerous articles by journalists who ‘quit’ their phones and write about how great life is without them. One writer went back to using a landline, the very thing called an addictive vice in the past.</p>
			
			<p><a href='https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/feb/11/smartphone-technology-addiction-facebook-twitter'>How I quit my smartphone addiction and really started living</a></p>
			
			<p>It’s only getting worse, apparently, with us all slipping further and further into digital quicksand.</p>

			<h2>Virtual reality</h2>
			
			<p>Before Oculus Rift even launched, the addiction narrative around VR had already begun. A short film called “Uncanny Valley” depicts a dystopian future of VR addicts living in derelict buildings and has over 1 million views.</p>

			<p>Technology has become more useful and entertaining over time, so it’s no surprise we spend more time with it than ever. To suggest this is a regressive addiction that can’t be stopped with a bit of adaptation and self-control, is lazy, cynical and <i>very</i> unoriginal.</p>
