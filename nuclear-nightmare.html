			<p>Thirty years ago today, it seemed like the worst of the West’s Cold War fears had been realized. The prospect of a nuclear event from the Soviet Union had long loomed over Europe. And on April 26th, 1986, it happened. Only it wasn’t an act of military aggression, but an accident at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant, and the Soviets were trying to hide it.</p>
			
			<p>The fallout from the accident at the Ukrainian plant included loss of human life, the terrifying threat of long term health problems for residents of dozen of major European cities, and radioactive soil—to say nothing of the harm done to any remaining notions of Soviet legitimacy. It was one of the biggest global environmental catastrophes in history. And it was scary as hell.</p>

		<p>The meltdown took place just a month after Mikhail Gorbachev announced a policy (and spirit) of glasnost, or “openness.” But Soviet authorities were far from open, reluctant to be honest about the extent of the disaster. They dragged their feet on evacuation efforts, and tried to hide the incident for three days.</p>

			<p>Western Europe looked on, fearful of radioactive clouds and contaminated food, and furious at the USSR for the cover-up. “The world’s worst nuclear accident was spawned by Soviet pride and made worse by Soviet secrecy,” <a href='http://www.nydailynews.com/news/world/soviets-cry-chernobyl-nuclear-disaster-article-1.2193103'>read</a> an April 30, 1986 article in the New York Daily News called “Soviets cry for help after Chernobyl nuclear disaster.”</p>

			<p>A 2005 UN report <a href='http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/releases/2005/pr38/en/'>estimated</a> that up to 4,000 people could eventually die from radiation exposure due to Chernobyl. But a study commissioned by Greenpeace <a href='http://www.greenpeace.org/international/en/news/features/chernobyl-deaths-180406/'>puts</a> the death toll around 93,000. International studies have <a href='http://www.who.int/ionizing_radiation/chernobyl/Chernobyl-update.pdf?ua=1'>reported</a> that, in addition to health problems, Chernobyl-affected populations were twice as likely to suffer from anxiety than those unaffected.</p>

		<p>Chernobyl was so frightening because it its impact was quite literally incalculable. Like the “Red Menace” itself, radiation after the disaster represented a diffuse but potent threat, with the potential to destroy a way of life. The disaster also dramatically affected public willingness to embrace nuclear power. It’s possible that not only geopolitics but climate change would look different if Chernobyl had never happened.</p>
